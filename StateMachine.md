Thank you for approving the confirmation. As agreed, we’ll proceed step-by-step through the flow, and the next step is **Design State Machines**. Below, I’ll provide a detailed description of the state machines for the CAN TP library’s sender and receiver, tailored to your requirements (ISO 15765-2:2016, two ECUs with CAN IDs 0x123 and 0x456, bidirectional communication, handling SF, FF, CF, FC, etc.). I’ll focus on this step alone, ensuring clarity and alignment with your project needs, and I’ll wait for your acceptance before moving to the next step (Define Data Structures).

### Design State Machines

The CAN TP library requires two state machines per ECU: one for the **sender** (sending SF, FF, CF) and one for the **receiver** (receiving SF, FF, CF, sending FC). Since both ECUs (ECU1: 0x123, ECU2: 0x456) can send and receive simultaneously, each ECU will run both state machines, with separate instances to manage concurrent sessions. The state machines will handle all frame types (Single Frame, First Frame, Consecutive Frame, Flow Control), enforce timers (N_As, N_Ar, N_Bs, N_Br, N_Cs, N_Cr), and log errors to CANoe’s Write window using `write()`.

#### 1. Sender State Machine
The sender state machine manages the transmission of messages (up to 4095 bytes) as SF or multi-frame (FF, CF), waiting for FC from the receiver, and respecting BS and STmin.

**States**:
- **Idle**: No active transmission. Waiting for a new message to send.
- **Sending SF**: Sending a Single Frame (≤7 bytes).
- **Sending FF**: Sending a First Frame for a multi-frame message (>7 bytes).
- **Waiting for FC**: Waiting for Flow Control frame after FF or a block of CFs.
- **Sending CFs**: Sending Consecutive Frames, respecting BS and STmin.
- **Completed**: Transmission finished successfully.
- **Error**: An error occurred (e.g., timeout, invalid FC).

**Transitions and Actions**:
| Current State      | Event/Condition                              | Action                                                                 | Next State         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Idle              | New message (≤7 bytes)                       | Pack SF (PCI=0x0, data), send on CAN ID (e.g., 0x123), start N_As    | Sending SF         |

| Sending FF        | FC received (FS=2, Abort)                    | Log “FC Abort” to Write window                                       | Error              |
| Waiting for FC    | FC received (FS=0, Continue)                 | Parse BS, STmin, start sending CFs, start N_As, STmin timer          | Sending CFs        |
| Waiting for FC    | FC received (FS=1, Wait)                     | Restart N_Bs timer, wait for next FC                                 | Waiting for FC     |

| Waiting for FC    | N_Bs timeout                                 | Log “N_Bs timeout” to Write window                                   | Error              |
| Sending CFs       | N_As timeout                                 | Log “N_As timeout” to Write window                                   | Error              |

| Error             | None                                         | Reset state, notify application                                      | Idle               |

**Notes**:
- **CAN IDs**: ECU1 sends SF/FF/CF on 0x123, ECU2 on 0x456.
- **STmin**: Enforced between CFs (0–127 ms, configured via panel).
- **BS**: Defines the number of CFs per block (0 = no limit, configured via panel).
- **Timers**: N_As (1000 ms) for frame transmission, N_Bs (1000 ms) for FC wait, N_Cs (2000 ms) for sender’s overall CF timeout.
- **Errors**: Invalid FS, SN, or timeouts are logged to the Write window (e.g., `write("N_Bs timeout");`).

#### 2. Receiver State Machine
The receiver state machine processes incoming SF, FF, and CF, sends FC with configured BS and STmin, and reassembles multi-frame messages.

**States**:
- **Idle**: No active reception. Waiting for SF or FF.
- **Receiving SF**: Processing a Single Frame.
- **Receiving FF**: Processing a First Frame, preparing to send FC.
- **Sending FC**: Sending Flow Control frame.
- **Receiving CFs**: Receiving Consecutive Frames, reassembling data.
- **Completed**: Reception finished successfully.
- **Error**: An error occurred (e.g., timeout, invalid SN).

**Transitions and Actions**:
| Current State      | Event/Condition                              | Action                                                                 | Next State         |

| Receiving FF      | Length > 4095 or no buffer                   | Send FC (FS=2, Abort), log “Overflow” to Write window                | Error              |
| Sending FC        | FC sent                                      | Wait for CFs, reset N_Ar timer                                       | Receiving CFs      |

| Receiving CFs     | CF received, valid SN                        | Store CF data, restart N_Cr timer                                    | Receiving CFs      |
| Receiving CFs     | CF received, invalid SN                      | Log “Invalid SN” to Write window, send FC (FS=2, Abort)              | Error              |
| Receiving CFs     | BS reached (block complete)                  | Send FC (FS=0, BS, STmin), restart N_Cr timer                        | Sending FC         |
| Receiving CFs     | All CFs received                             | Reassemble data, deliver to application, reset timers                | Completed          |
| Receiving CFs     | N_Cr timeout                                 | Log “N_Cr timeout” to Write window, send FC (FS=2, Abort)            | Error              |

**Notes**:
- **CAN IDs**: ECU1 sends FC on 0x123 when receiving, ECU2 on 0x456.
- **BS/STmin**: Configured via panel, included in FC (STmin as 0x00–0x7F).
- **Timers**: N_Ar (1000 ms) for FC transmission, N_Br (1000 ms) for frame reception, N_Cr (2000 ms) for CF timeout.
- **Reassembly**: Stores CF data in a buffer (up to 4095 bytes), validates SN (1 to 15, wraps around).
- **Errors**: Invalid SN, length, or timeouts are logged to the Write window.

#### 3. Concurrent Operation
- Each ECU runs both state machines simultaneously:
  - ECU1: Sender (Tx on 0x123, SF/FF/CF) + Receiver (Rx on 0x456, Tx FC on 0x123).
  - ECU2: Sender (Tx on 0x456, SF/FF/CF) + Receiver (Rx on 0x123, Tx FC on 0x456).
- Separate instances (e.g., variables, timers) ensure no conflicts between sender/receiver or ECU1/ECU2 sessions.
- CAPL’s event-driven model (`on message`, `on timer`) handles concurrency naturally.

#### 4. Text-Based Diagram
Below is a simplified text representation of the state machines (graphical diagrams are not feasible in text, but I can describe transitions further if needed).

**Sender State Machine**:
```
Idle
  ↓ (New message ≤7 bytes)
Sending SF → Completed
  ↓ (New message >7 bytes)
Sending FF → Waiting for FC (FC: FS=0) → Sending CFs → Completed
  ↓ (FC: FS=1)           ↓ (BS reached)
Waiting for FC ←←←←←←←← Sending CFs
  ↓ (Timeout, FS=2, Invalid FC)
Error → Idle
```

**Receiver State Machine**:
```
Idle
  ↓ (SF received)
Receiving SF → Completed
  ↓ (FF received)
Receiving FF → Sending FC (FS=0) → Receiving CFs → Completed
  ↓ (BS reached)
Sending FC ←←←←←←←← Receiving CFs
  ↓ (Timeout, FS=2, Invalid SN, Length > 4095)
Error → Idle
```
